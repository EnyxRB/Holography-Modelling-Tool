# Holography-Modelling-Tool
My tool designed for creation, manipulation and exporting of holograms in Expression2 (Art of Holography)

What does it do?:
  - HOLOGRAPHY is the science and practice of making holograms
  # This tool enables a more practical way of creating and modelling detailed hologram models in Expression2.
  # Meaning you don't have to edit that same line of code over and over just to get the damn thing
  # in the right position. I've been there before. Even for the experienced holo modelers, this makes the entire process
  # massively quicker... once you know the commands...

Installation instructions:

  - Recommended:
  Download ZIP and paste entire folder into steamapps/garrysmod/garrysmod/data/expression2/e2shared.
  Why in the e2shared folder? - The software uses a bunch of file write and read functions and therefore due to wiremods coding, requires the code to be written/examined to be one of a select few chosen folders. Put it in e2shared and you will not have any problems.
  
  - Other:
  Use an SVN client such as tortoiseSVN to auto update from github. I only recommend ZIP because I have implemented my own auto update option which is completely optional, unlike SVN and will only update the files I deem important to update.

Useage Instructions:
  #1. Place the Holography Modelling Tool E2 on the ground (main/Holography_Modelling_Tool.txt)
  #2. Place the Holography Modelling Tool Slave E2 on the ground (main/Holography_Modelling_Tool_Slave.txt)
  #3. Make your creation using the commands and controls above
  #4. Remember to -save followed by a filename often so you dont loose your progress
  #4. Type -export followed by the filename you wish the E2 to have
  #5. Right click on the placed slave E2 and save it
  #6. Got yourself a holo model
